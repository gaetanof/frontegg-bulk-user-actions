Frontegg Bulk User Actions (Lock/Delete)

CLI script to lock (lock) or delete (delete) users in Frontegg in bulk, accepting both emails and IDs (UUIDs).
By default, the script runs in dry-run mode (no changes) unless you explicitly use --execute.

‚∏ª

üöÄ Requirements
‚Ä¢ Python 3.9+
‚Ä¢ Packages: requests, python-dotenv
‚Ä¢ Frontegg Vendor credentials: FRONTEGG_CLIENT_ID and FRONTEGG_API_TOKEN

Recommended: use a virtual environment (venv) per project.

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install requests python-dotenv

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration 1. Create a .env file in the same folder as app.py.

Example .env:

# Frontegg API Configuration

FRONTEGG_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
FRONTEGG_API_TOKEN=yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy
FRONTEGG_TENANT_ID= # (optional) if set, DELETE will act only within that tenant
FRONTEGG_REGION=EU # EU | US | AP

# Rate Limiting Configuration

RATE_LIMIT_DELAY=0.5 # seconds between requests
MAX_RETRIES=3

# Bulk Action Configuration

USER_ID_ARRAY=user1@company.com,user2@company.com,3f7ac2e3-55c7-4dcb-9b9a-0f8f6f0b9d1a
USER_ACTION=lock # lock | delete (can be overridden by CLI)

Key variables
‚Ä¢ USER_ID_ARRAY: comma-separated list of emails or user IDs (UUIDs).
‚Ä¢ If you pass an email, the script resolves the userId via the API GET /identity/resources/users/v1/email?email=....
‚Ä¢ If you pass a UUID, it is used directly.
‚Ä¢ USER_ACTION: default action if not passed via CLI. Allowed values: lock or delete.
‚Ä¢ FRONTEGG_TENANT_ID (optional):
‚Ä¢ For DELETE: if set, the user is removed from that tenant (using header frontegg-tenant-id).
‚Ä¢ If not set, the user is deleted globally.
‚Ä¢ FRONTEGG_REGION: EU | US | AP.

‚∏ª

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Dry-run (default, no changes)

python app.py --action lock

# or using the value from .env

python app.py

2. Execute for real

python app.py --action lock --execute
python app.py --action delete --execute

If you don‚Äôt specify --action and USER_ACTION is missing/invalid, the program will show a clear error message with usage instructions and stop.

‚∏ª

üß† Supported Actions
‚Ä¢ lock: blocks a user (prevents login).
‚Ä¢ Endpoint: POST /identity/resources/users/v1/{userId}/lock
‚Ä¢ delete: removes a user (globally or from a tenant if FRONTEGG_TENANT_ID is set).
‚Ä¢ Endpoint: DELETE /identity/resources/users/v1/{userId}
‚Ä¢ Optional header: frontegg-tenant-id: <FRONTEGG_TENANT_ID>
‚Ä¢ email ‚Üí userId resolution:
‚Ä¢ Endpoint: GET /identity/resources/users/v1/email?email=<email>

Authentication is done via:
POST {gateway}/auth/vendor/
Gateways by region:
‚Ä¢ EU: https://api.frontegg.com
‚Ä¢ US: https://api.us.frontegg.com
‚Ä¢ AP: https://api.ap.frontegg.com

üß™ Examples

Dry-run lock with mixed emails and IDs

python app.py --action lock

Expected summary:

SUMMARY: would lock 3 user(s); failed to resolve 0.

Execute delete for a tenant

.env:

FRONTEGG_TENANT_ID=b44c26fc-1a89-4b23-9156-e5daa779b517
USER_ID_ARRAY=user1@company.com,user2@company.com
USER_ACTION=delete

Run:

python app.py --execute

Result: those users are deleted from the tenant (not globally).

‚∏ª

üß© Quick Commands
‚Ä¢ Dry-run with action from .env:

python app.py

    ‚Ä¢	Dry-run overriding action:

python app.py --action lock

    ‚Ä¢	Execute real changes:

python app.py --action delete --execute

    ‚Ä¢	Activate venv:

source venv/bin/activate

‚∏ª

üõü Troubleshooting

1. Missing or invalid action
   ‚Ä¢ Neither --action nor a valid USER_ACTION (lock/delete) provided.
   ‚Ä¢ Solution: pass --action lock or add USER_ACTION=lock to .env.

2. Failed to authenticate with Frontegg (401)
   ‚Ä¢ Check FRONTEGG_CLIENT_ID, FRONTEGG_API_TOKEN.
   ‚Ä¢ Make sure .env is in the same folder as app.py.
   ‚Ä¢ Region must match your tenant (EU/US/AP).

3. User not found when using email
   ‚Ä¢ Verify the email exists in Frontegg and matches exactly.
   ‚Ä¢ The script uses GET /identity/resources/users/v1/email.

4. ‚ÄúUser locked but UI doesn‚Äôt show it‚Äù
   ‚Ä¢ Confirm you‚Äôre calling the correct region.
   ‚Ä¢ Refresh UI or check for caching.

5. externally-managed-environment error on macOS/Homebrew
   ‚Ä¢ Use a venv:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install requests python-dotenv

‚∏ª

üì¶ Dependencies

requirements.txt (optional):

requests
python-dotenv

Install:

pip install -r requirements.txt

‚∏ª

üîí Best Practices
‚Ä¢ Always run in dry-run first.
‚Ä¢ Test with a small set of users before running in production.
‚Ä¢ Use FRONTEGG_TENANT_ID for scoped deletes, to avoid global deletions by mistake.
‚Ä¢ Back up/export data before mass deletions.

‚ùì FAQ

Can I mix emails and IDs?
Yes. The script auto-detects UUIDs, otherwise resolves by email.

Which region should I use?
Set FRONTEGG_REGION (EU | US | AP) to match your tenant.

Can I delete only from a tenant without global removal?
Yes: set FRONTEGG_TENANT_ID. The script will send the header and remove the user only from that tenant.

What does dry-run do?
It resolves IDs, validates the API calls, and prints what would happen without making changes.
